## Smithsonian Folkways Catalogue Visualization

This map was created at the first annual National Day of Civic Hacking in Washington, D.C. Smithsonian Folkways Recordings partnered with three community volunteers to tackle the task of creating an engaging visualization of Smithsonian Folkways' music collection. Together, we explored various visualization platforms, customizations, search filters, and social media strategies that could display musical catalogue content. This demo provides a scalable map of the entire Smithsonian Folkways catalogue, as well as an overview of filters that may be used to micromanage the dataset to create a more customized browsing experience. 

The hacking team included Chris Herwig, Preston Rhea, Terry Scott, Sojin Kim, Atesh Sonnborn and Meredith Holmgren. Saturday, June 1, 2013.
